principle:
1. Principle of Least Knowledge: talk
   only to your immediate friends.

pattern:
1. The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class
   into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets
   classes work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of
   incompatible interfaces.
2. The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a
   set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higherlevel
   interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
